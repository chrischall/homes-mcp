# homes-mcp

MCP server for homes.com — natural-language access to listings, property records, price/tax history, market reports, saved homes/searches, and photo galleries. Routes through your signed-in homes.com tab via the fetchproxy browser extension, so AWS WAF sees a real browser session instead of a Node process.

- **npm:** [npmjs.com/package/homes-mcp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homes-mcp)
- **Source:** [github.com/chrischall/homes-mcp](https://github.com/chrischall/homes-mcp)

> ⚠️ homes.com does not publish a public consumer API. This server reads the Schema.org JSON-LD blob (and some DOM-side sections) embedded in each SSR page, dispatched through your own signed-in browser tab via the fetchproxy extension. Use at your own discretion.

## Setup

### 1. Install homes-mcp

`.mcp.json` (project) or `~/.claude/mcp.json` (global):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "homes": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "homes-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Install the fetchproxy extension (one-time, shared across all fetchproxy-based MCPs)

The extension lives in its own repo and is installed separately — it is **not** bundled in this repo. Follow the install instructions at [github.com/chrischall/fetchproxy](https://github.com/chrischall/fetchproxy), then load the built extension in Chrome via `chrome://extensions` → Developer mode → Load unpacked.

### 3. Open homes.com and sign in.

That's it. No API keys, no env vars. (Sign-in isn't strictly required for the public-listing tools, but having a real session active helps the page render the way the extractors expect — and saved-homes / saved-searches require it.)

## Tools

### Search & resolve

- **`homes_search_properties`** — Search by free-text location (city, ZIP, neighborhood). Slugifies the input into homes.com's URL routing. Filters by `property_type`, `listing_type`, `sort`, and a `price_min`/`price_max` band (homes.com's `?price-min=`/`?price-max=` query facet). Returns each listing's address, price, beds/baths, sqft, primary photo, listing agent + brokerage. Caps at the ~40-listing SSR page; sets `truncated`/`total_estimated` when the market has more.
- **`homes_get_by_address`** — Resolve a single US street address to its canonical homes.com property URL + opaque property hash. Walks structured smartsearch typeahead → slug routing → city/zip search-fallback, verifying each candidate with a whole-token street + unit match. Returns `matched_via` and degrades gracefully to `{ resolved: false }`.
- **`homes_resolve_addresses`** — Bulk version of `homes_get_by_address` (up to 100 addresses, input order preserved, per-row outcomes). Prefer for any batch ≥ 3.

### Property details

- **`homes_get_property`** — Full record for a property by URL. Parses JSON-LD + DOM-side sections: address, lat/lng, beds/baths, sqft, year built, price, status, listing agent + brokerage, highlights, schools, HOA (raw + normalized monthly), lot size (sqft + derived acres), parking, heating/cooling, MLS id/source, tax, days-on-market, price drops, and server-derived `extracted_features`. Optional inline `price_history` / `tax_history`.
- **`homes_get_property_photos`** — Full photo gallery scraped from `<img>` tags on the detail page (JSON-LD carries only one image). Returns `{ url, position, alt? }` per photo, filtered to the homes.com CDN.
- **`homes_bulk_get`** — Fetch up to 200 properties' structured records in one call (per-row errors captured, input order preserved). Use instead of looping when you just want the records.
- **`homes_compare_properties`** — Side-by-side comparison of 2–8 properties with an aligned summary table. Concurrent fetches, per-row errors.
- **`homes_get_nearby_listings`** — The "Homes for Sale Near This Property" cross-link cards from a detail page (For Sale, optionally Rentals). URL + address only.

### History & market

- **`homes_get_history`** — Combined price + tax history in one fetch: `listing_events`, `ownership_events`, `lien_events`, cross-MCP-normalized `events_normalized`, and `tax_records`. (Preferred over the two split tools below.)
- **`homes_get_property_history`** — *Deprecated* — price/ownership/lien timelines only. Prefer `homes_get_history`.
- **`homes_get_tax_history`** — *Deprecated* — year-by-year tax records only. Prefer `homes_get_history`.
- **`homes_get_market_report`** — Median / average / $-per-sqft for a market, derived from the `sold` search page's JSON-LD.

### Saved (auth-gated)

- **`homes_get_saved_homes`** — The signed-in user's saved (favorited) homes. Requires an authenticated homes.com tab.
- **`homes_get_saved_searches`** — The signed-in user's saved searches. Requires an authenticated homes.com tab.

### Local calculators (no network)

- **`homes_calculate_mortgage`** — Local PITI calculator (price, rate, down payment, taxes, insurance, HOA, PMI → monthly breakdown).
- **`homes_calculate_affordability`** — Local affordability calculator — max purchase price under standard 28/36 DTI.
- **`homes_estimate_rent_vs_buy`** — Local rent-vs-buy model. **You must supply `monthly_rent`** — homes.com publishes no rental estimate to impute it (see Gotchas).

### Diagnostics & sessions

- **`homes_healthcheck`** — Round-trips `/robots.txt` through the fetchproxy bridge; distinguishes "bridge down" vs "extension not connected" vs "homes.com-side problem."
- **`homes_get_session_context`**, **`homes_register_session`**, **`homes_set_active_session`** — List / register / switch logical homes.com sessions.

## Trigger examples

- "Find me condos for sale in Atlanta under $500k on homes.com" → `homes_search_properties` (with `price_max`)
- "Resolve 3199 Delmar Ln NW, Atlanta GA to a homes.com listing" → `homes_get_by_address`
- "What's the price history for this homes.com listing?" → `homes_get_history` (or `homes_get_property` with `include_price_history`)
- "Show me all photos for this homes.com listing" → `homes_get_property_photos`
- "What's the market report for sold homes in Brooklyn?" → `homes_get_market_report`
- "List my saved homes on homes.com" → `homes_get_saved_homes`
- "Monthly payment on a $500k home, 20% down, 6.5% rate" → `homes_calculate_mortgage`

## Gotchas

- **AWS WAF challenge.** homes.com (CoStar) gates traffic through AWS WAF and occasionally serves a challenge page to fresh sessions. Solving it in the Chrome tab once unblocks subsequent fetches; the client detects the interstitial and throws `SessionNotAuthenticatedError`.
- **No write surface.** All tools are read-only. Saving a home / contact forms are not implemented.
- **Property URL is required for detail tools.** `get_property`, `get_property_photos`, `compare_properties`, history, photos, and nearby all need a full property URL from a search or `get_by_address` result — there's no stable way to construct one from a property id alone.
- **No rental estimate to impute.** homes.com publishes no `rent_zestimate` analogue, so `homes_estimate_rent_vs_buy` requires you to pass `monthly_rent`. For a rent figure to plug in, use a sibling MCP (`zillow_get_property` carries `rent_zestimate`; `redfin_get_comparable_rentals` returns rental comps).
